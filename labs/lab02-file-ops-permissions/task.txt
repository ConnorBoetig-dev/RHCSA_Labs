RHCSA Lab 02 - File Operations and Permissions

SCENARIO:
You have been provided a system with various files in the incoming/ directory that need proper
organization and permissions. As a system administrator, you must organize these files into
the appropriate workspace directories and set correct permissions for security compliance.

INITIAL EXPLORATION:
Before starting, run these commands to understand the current state:
- tree (to see directory structure)
- ls -la incoming/ (to see files and their current permissions)
- ls -la workspace/ (to see workspace subdirectories)

TASKS TO COMPLETE:

Task 1: Move Text Files
Move all .txt files from incoming/ to workspace/documents/
EXCEPT meeting-notes.txt (this file needs special handling in Task 2)

Task 2: Move and Rename Meeting Notes
Move meeting-notes.txt from incoming/ to workspace/documents/daily-standup.txt
(rename the file during the move operation)

Task 3: Create Backup Copy
Copy app-config.conf from incoming/ to archive/ directory for backup purposes
(original file should remain in incoming/ for now)

Task 4: Move Configuration File
Move the original app-config.conf from incoming/ to workspace/configs/
(after backup copy is made in Task 3)

Task 5: Move Script and Fix Permissions
Move development-script.sh to workspace/scripts/ and make it executable
(the script currently lacks execute permissions)

Task 6: Set Configuration File Permissions
Set permissions on all files in workspace/configs/ directory so that:
- Owner can read and write
- Group can read only
- Others cannot access the file at all
(Use octal notation: 640)

Task 7: Verify Directory Permissions
Ensure all workspace directories have standard directory permissions (755):
- Owner: read, write, execute
- Group: read, execute
- Others: read, execute

VERIFICATION:
Run ./check.sh to verify all tasks are completed correctly.
The script will check each requirement and display PASS/FAIL status.

SUCCESS CRITERIA:
- All files properly organized in correct directories
- No files remain in incoming/ directory
- Script is executable
- Configuration files have secure permissions (640)
- All directories have proper permissions (755)

RESET LAB:
Run ./setup.sh anytime to completely reset the lab to its initial state.

COMMANDS YOU WILL NEED:
mv, cp, chmod, ls -la, tree

PERMISSION REFERENCE:
755 (directories) = rwxr-xr-x (owner: full, group/others: read+execute)
644 (files) = rw-r--r-- (owner: read+write, group/others: read only)
640 (secure files) = rw-r----- (owner: read+write, group: read only, others: none)
755 (scripts) = rwxr-xr-x (executable by all)

TIME ESTIMATE: 10-15 minutes
DIFFICULTY: Beginner to Intermediate
